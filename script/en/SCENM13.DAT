Why are there so many stone
statues in this town?<>

?!
Something's coming at us from
our flanks!<>

AAAH!
They're Basilisks!<>

What?!<clsr>
Then these statues...
My god, they're people!<>

They must have been turned
to stone by these creatures!<>

What can we do?
There must be some way to turn
them back...<>

Hmmm... this mirror...?<clsr>
UWAAAA!
Blinding light!<>

What is this mirror...?<clsr>
This mirror.... this mirror...<clsr>
Does it possess holy powers?!<>

My body... I can move it!<>

Has the stone curse
been broken?!<clsr>
All troops!
Crush every last one of these
lizards!<>

Lance!<clsr>
Why are you here?<>

We'll talk later!<clsr>
First let's kill these damn
lizards!<>

I understand.<clsr>
Everyone, let's go!<>

Kill every last one of them!<>

Can we really defeat all of
them...<>

Take this!<>

I can't fight anymore.<clsr>
Please handle the rest!<>

This little fucker!!!<>

Shit!<clsr>
I can't move my leg!
You'll have to take care
of them for me!<>

Everyone, be careful! We have to
avoid being turned to stone!<>

Chris, are you alright?!<>

Yes!<clsr>
I just need a rest!<>

Arrr...these scurvy monsters!
Kill every bloody one of 'em!<>

I'm retreating this time!<clsr>
Sorry!<>

That monster seems to have
done something to
the people.<>

I won't let you harm anyone else!<>

I can't do anything more.<clsr>
I'm beaten this time.<>

Don't move!<>

I was careless...<>

Let's go!<>

Kuuu...<clsr>
I leave the rest of my duties
to you.<>

You bastards, how dare you turn
me to stone!<clsr>
I won't forgive you!<>

Lance, are you okay?<>

What the hell is this thing?!<>

Leave the rest to us!<>

Sorry!<>

Kyaaa!<>

Kyaaa!<>

Well, that looks like the last
of them.<clsr>
So Lance, will you explain why
you're here like you promised?<>

It looks like that's the
last of them...<>

My body...
Ha ha! I can move again!<>

Is the stone curse lifting?<>

Lance!<clsr>
Why are you here?!<>

GYOGYOOO!<>

PUSHAAA!<>

GYOGYOOO!<>

GAEEEN!<>

GUGAAAA!<>

GOOON!<>

GUGAAAA!<>

GAEEEN!<>

After fleeing Dalshis, I was
pursued by the monsters and
eventually trapped here.<clsr>
The monsters seem to be getting
stronger.<clsr>
By the time I arrived here,
I could barely injure them
anymore.<>

...<clsr>
Because the seal on Langrisser
was broken, this evil has been
released into the world.<>

It appears there was truth to
that story of the sword sealing
away a great evil.<clsr>
In this case, I'll cooperate
with you.<clsr>
However, only until the monsters
are defeated.<clsr>
After that, we finish our battle.<>

In that case, we both need to
live through this.<>

Heh, it would seem so.<clsr>
Try not to get yourself killed,
Ledin.<>

The same to you, Lance.<>
