My prince! I see the shadow of a
woman ahead of us!<>

What?!
Oh, it looks like she's a priest.<>

Eyaa!?<>

Don't be frightened. We're just
travelers.<>

I'm sorry, I was just startled,
that's all...<>

You have good reason to be cautious.
It's widely known that this area is
home to a den of thieves!<>

My name is Chris, I'm traveling on
a pilgrimage.
I was going to Salrath, but...<>

Is that so?
My name is Ledin.<clsr>
Please allow us to escort you
there.<>

I'm sorry.
I don't want you to go out of
your way...<>

Worry not, Lady Chris.
We were on our way to Salrath
as well.<>

My prince, this field is not as
empty as it was a moment ago...<>

The thieves?!<>

Chris, the town is only a little
further!<clsr>
Run for it as fast as you can!<>

the rear as well!<>

The town is finally in sight!<clsr>
Don't stop running, Chris!<>

O... OK.<>

Take this!<>

I didn't have the strength to
protect her alone...<>

You need to stay with her if you're
going to protect Chris!<>

I understand.<>

Here's ten years worth of swordplay
coming at you!<>

Ugh... maybe I still needed
another year...<>

I must protect our town to keep
the peace! <>

I don't know...<clsr>
When last I saw him he was engaged
in battle.<clsr>
I was sent to rally reinforcements
and return as soon as possible.<>

I understand.
I'll rally some able soldiers who
are willing to fight.<clsr>
But for tonight, prince, please
rest here.<>
