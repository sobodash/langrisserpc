My prince, we're in trouble!<clsr>
This town is under siege by a 
pack of wolfmen!<>

My prince, we're in trouble!<clsr>
This town is under siege by
a pack of wolfmen!<>

What?!<clsr>
We must hurry to their aid!<>

FYA HA HA HA!<clsr>
I can't allow that to happen
now, can I?
Prince of Baldea...<>

Who's there?!<>

Oh ho, he has some fire.<clsr>
You may call me Nagya...
I have a feeling we're going to
get to know each other VERY well...<>

Whatever, I suggest you get
out of my way!<>

Ah, you see, that may be a bit
of a problem.<clsr>
It would make our dark god
quite happy to have a
descendant of light as a sacrifice.
I'd hate to let him down.<>

HYA HYA HYA!<clsr>
I have a better idea. How about
we make everyone in this
town a sacrifice?<>

WAOOOON!<>

WAOOOON!<>

Damn!<clsr>
They have the town surrounded...!<>

Everyone, hurry!<clsr>
We have to save the townspeople!<>

Aye aye!<>

I can't let you do as you please!<>

It's useless...<clsr>
At this rate the villagers...<>

Kyaaa!<>

Lady Narm!<clsr>
Are you all right?!<>

I'm going to have to retreat.<clsr>
Please, take care of this!<>

This is the finishing blow!<>

Shit!<clsr>
My knees!
You'll have to handle it from here.<>

Hurry, we have to save everyone!<>

Kyaaa!<>

Stop imitating Narm!<>

Kuh, I've failed!<>

Kuuu!<>

It's useless...<>

I won't let you have your way!<>

Shit!<>

These god damn monsters!<>

I can't go on!<clsr>
This looks like the end...<>

This is all because of my
kingdom's abuse of the sword,
Langrisser...<clsr>
We must find a way to reseal
this evil.<>

I won't let you guys get away
alive!<>

Shit!<clsr>
My arm is failing me...<>

Kuu!<>

This.... this is it...<clsr>
Everyone from Baldea...<clsr>
... the rest... is in 
your hands...<>

Kyaaaa!
Please, help me!<>

Evacuate the citizens to the
center of the village!<clsr>
The monsters can't be allowed
further into the town!<>

Kyaaa!<>

Killing one of these beasts
does nothing!<clsr>
There's just no end to them!<>

My luck has run out...<>

Wh- What?!<clsr>
The villagers are being
massacred...<clsr>
I don't have the strength to
save them...<>

GUWAAAAA!<>

GUWAAAAA!<>

GUWAAAAA!<>

GUWAAAAA!<>

GUWAAAAA!<>

GUWAAAAA!<>

Our god is awesome, I'll
show you some of his power.<>

What a shame, today doesn't
seem to be going our way.<clsr>
But the Prince of Darkness,
Böser, will hear of this.
And you fools have NO chance
against him!<clsr>
So then, I guess we'll meet
again, descendants of light.<>

Kyaaa!
Save me!<>

Kyaaa!<>

It seems everyone is safe.<>

Thank you for saving us.<>

I deeply thank you.<clsr>
It was only by your help
that everyone is alive.<>

Ah, it's not that great
of a feat, really.<>

Prince Ledin, for your help,
we'd like to give you our
town's secret treasure.<>

Obtained the Crown!<>

Thank you, I'm sure it will
aid us.<>

It's something to remember our
town's eternal gratitude by.<>

No, your thanks is
really sufficient.<>

But Lord Ledin.<clsr>
What kind of a man is this Böser?<>

However, Lord Ledin.<clsr>
What kind of a man is this Böser?<>

I don't really know.<clsr>
Jessica, do you know anything
about him?<>

I know much of Böser...<clsr>
Böser is the name of the man
who, since ancient times,
has tried to raise the power
to revive his dark god, Chaos.<clsr>
Since Nagya called him the
"Prince of Darkness," the man he
spoke of and the man I mention are
likely one and the same.<>

Such an evil man would truly
try to awaken a dark god.<clsr>
It seems our fight has
become for the very future...<>
