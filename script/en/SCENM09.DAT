This river looks pretty big.
There doesn't appear to be any
cover for them.<>

Their ground lies pretty deep in
the current. Crossing there would
be a bad move.<clsr>
We'll need to find another point
in the river.<>

Ho! The dogs be spread out across
the other bank!<clsr>
Blimey! They may have been
expectin' us after all...<>

It doesn't matter.<clsr>
We'll force our way through!<>

The enemy is moving!<clsr>
It looks like we'll need to break
through them here!<>

Ho! A free fight may be our best
move I say!<>

There's no way we'll be able to
cross the Warl at this point.<>

The enemy's forces consist of
sailor units!<>

If we engage them in the water,
we'd be at a considerable
disadvantage.<>

Let's try to lure the monsters
onto the land.<clsr>
If we can pull it off, we'll have
a tactical advantage!<>

Hmmm, it seems like it may be
a little dangerous, though.<>

Lance?!<>

Sigh... How unexpected, Ledin.<clsr>
I never thought I'd encounter you
while hunting these monsters.<>

Damn!<clsr>
What horrible timing!<>

Don't let them escape!<clsr>
Just ignore the monsters and keep
after those guys!<>

Somehow we managed a victory.<>

But... what were those monsters?<>

But... what were those monsters?<>

That kind of beast surely was not
the companion of any mortal.<>

That kind of beast surely was not
the companion of any mortal.<>

Could it be that the powers of
darkness have already awakened?!<>

Could it be that the powers of
darkness have already awakened?!<>

Perhaps... I fear that may be.<>

Perhaps... I fear that may be.<>

Maybe those monsters were after
Langrisser...<>

Maybe those monsters were after
Langrisser...<>

If that's the case...
then it's all more reason to
hurry!<>

Don't let up!<clsr>
Keep moving and break through
their line!<>

Ugh......<clsr>
Is this it......?<>

Take this!<>

Aaah!<>

Muu?!<>

Shit!<clsr>
This is it!<>

Eiii!<>

!<>

Yo ho! Learn the terror of
the dread Captain Taylor!<>

Damn!<clsr>
I was caught off-guard!<>

Witness my blinding magic!<>

I will not go down!<>

I'll carve us a path through
these guys with sheer power if
need be!<>

Not bad...<>

Lance is here to back us up!
This is our chance!
Counterattack and crush them all!<>

Understood!<>

Touuu!<>

Gyaa!<>

OW!
P-P-Painful!!!<>

Curses!
Do ye expect me to go down
quietly?<clsr>
Avast, I'll make ya dance with
ole' Jack Ketch!<>

I'm not fucking around!<>

L- Lady Celia...<>

Guess I'm gonna have to show
you what real pain is!<>

This- This is impossible...<clsr>
Gwaaa!<>

Lord Zeld...<clsr>
I'll show you what I,
Celia, can do!<>

This won't be like the last time!<>

I can't be defeated!<>

Lord Zeld...<clsr>
I've been defeated...<>

GUGIIIII!<>

GYOGYOOO!<>

GYOGYOOO!<>

The time of our conclusion is at
hand!<clsr>
Prepare yourself!<>

Do you really think you can
defeat me?!<>

Ledin!<clsr>
The time to conclude our duel
is now!<>

That's just what I wanted
to hear!<>

Keh! Is defeating him really
beyond my power...?!<>

Somehow we managed a victory.<>

But... what was that monster?<>

Arrr... such a beast be not the
companion of any mortal..<>

Could it be the powers of
darkness?!<>

Perhaps... that may be.<>

Maybe those monsters were
after Langrisser...<>

If that's the case...
then it's all more reason to
hurry!<>

GYAGIIII!<>

GISYAAAAA!<>

What the, those monsters, are they
their companions?!<>

What the hell are they?<>

What!?
What the hell are those things
doing here?!<>

... Don't get distracted!<clsr>
Just concentrate on striking down
those Baldean bastards! Worry about
the monsters later!<>
