holding out for reinforcements.<>

Use caution in engagement, they
could be plotting something.<>

Wh-What?!<>

come...<clsr>
Gufuu!<>

How foolish...<>

The remaining soldiers are
fleeing.<>

Don't worry about them, they're
no longer of any consequence.<>

Lord Ledin!<clsr>

Not a chance, your help would be
greatly appreciated.<>

It's time to prepare for the
final stage of our advance!<>

object a while ago.<>

It's a magical wand.<clsr>

you.<>

Obtained a Wand!<>

Prince!<clsr>
Our preparations are almost
complete!<>
