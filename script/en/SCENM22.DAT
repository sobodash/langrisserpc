An explanation of this world's
tactics may aid you on your
quest.<>

Would you like an explanation?<>

Very well then, I'll teach you
the basics of battle tactics.<clsr>
Your units consist of commanders
and soldiers.<clsr>
The commanders include yourself
and your companions.<clsr>
Soldiers must be hired for at the
start of every stage.<clsr>
Purchasing troops is a necessary
preparation for battle.<>

Would you like me to explain
Command Range?<>

When battle actually begins, try
to keep soldiers in the vicinity
of their commander.<clsr>
The blinking area around the
commander is called
the Command Range.<clsr>
Soldiers within this zone receive
a bonus to their Attack and
Defense statistics.<clsr>
It is very dangerous for a lone
soldier unit to enter combat when
outside the range.<>

Would you like me to explain
troop HP recovery?<>

A unit adjacent to its commander
will recover 3 HP at the start
of every turn.<clsr>
The only other way to recover
unit HP is by using magic.<clsr>
Also remember, as HP decreases,
so does the strength of a
unit's attack.<>

Would you like me to explain
commander HP recovery?<>

A commander can regain 3 HP if
you select the Heal command.<clsr>
You may also recover 2 MP by
doing this.<>

Would you like an explanation
of troop affinity?<>

Each unit type has its own
attribute.<clsr>
Depending on its attribute, it
will have an advantage or
a disadvantage in combat.<clsr>
Here are some of the basics...<clsr>
Infantry are strong against
pikemen, but weak against
cavalry.<clsr>
Pikemen are strong against
cavalry, but weak against
infantry.<clsr>
Cavalry are strong against
infantry, but weak against 
pikemen.<clsr>
Sea units are slow on land
but fast in the water.<clsr>
Flying units have excellent
mobility, but are incredibly
weak to bowmen.<clsr>
Bowmen can attack the enemy
from a distance and are strong
against flying soldiers.<clsr>
However, they cannot withstand
a direct assault and will
likely be wiped out.<clsr>
Consider the map, as well as the
commanders' arrangement, before
hiring your troops.<>

Would you like an explanation
on how to gain EXP?<>

When a troop defeats an enemy
unit, some EXP is awarded to
its commander.<clsr>
When an enemy commander is
defeated, all troops under its
command are destroyed as well.<clsr>
However, no EXP will be gained
from such kills.<clsr>
That's why it's best to defeat
all troops before defeating the
commander.<>

Would you like an explanation
on how to position your
Commanders?<>

Before conducting your sortie,
all your Commander units must
be positioned on the map.<clsr>
Commanders to be positioned will
have their names shown in bright
white.<clsr>
Also, depending on the stage
there may be times when the
arrangement is fixed.<clsr>
In this case, you can't position
commanders, but you can still
purchase troops and items.<>

You should have a good
understanding of common tactics
by now.<clsr>
Don't forget to hire troops.<clsr>
A single unit may mean the
difference between victory or
defeat...<>

Well then, I hope to see you
perform your best.<>
