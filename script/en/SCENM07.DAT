Eh? You STILL aren't dead?!<clsr>
Everyone, form up for a stronger
attack!
Let's crush that bastard!<>

Yes sir!<>

Looks like these guys are getting
serious...<>

It's no good!
We're badly outnumbered!<clsr>
If we continue like this, we'll
be wiped out!<>

Quit your bitching!
We may be outnumbered, but we're
not yet outmatched!<clsr>
The prince will come to help
us for sure!
Just do your best until then!<>

Who is that defending Anzel
Fortress?<>

If I'm not mistaken, that looks
like Albert and his company.<>

Sink me! I can scarce believe that
landlubber's held out this long.<>

All right!
Let's drive these guys out!<>

I wonder how much longer Albert
can hold that line?<>

Hurry up!<clsr>
We need to help Albert as soon
as possible!<>

Ledin!<clsr>
I'll pay you back for the
humiliation I suffered before!<>

Is that Lance?
Damn, not again.<>

That's right!
I told you we'd cross swords
again.<clsr>
Today is that day!
Have at you!<>

It's the prince!<clsr>
The prince himself came to help!
Everyone! We just need to hold
out a little longer!<>

Wait for me, Albert!<clsr>
I'll be there to help you soon!<>

Wait for me, Albert!<clsr>
I'm coming to help you right now!<>

Out of my way!<>

Sorry, Albert...
It seems I've fallen early...<>

I can't let you continue to do
as you please!<>

Aaaah!<>

Narm, back off!<>

If you don't want to die,
get the fuck out of my way!<>

Shit!
My arm has had it!<clsr>
I'm have to leave the rest to you!<>

Albert is in danger, we have to
hurry!<>

This isn't good!<>

Eeeeek!<>

Avast! On the seas, all scallywags
feared the name of Captain Tyler!<clsr>
Want to know why?
Because dead men tell no tales,
savvy?<>

Damn!
These guys aren't going down
without a fight, are they?<>

Hold it right there!<>

Aaaah!<>

You must not falter! <clsr>
Don't fall back even one step!
We have to hold out till the
prince arrives!<>

Lord Albert!<clsr>
The line is breaking!
We can't hold out any more!<>

Damn, I'm helpless.<clsr>
If I'm going down, I'm taking
you with me!<>

Not yet!
I won't be defeated yet!<>

Guhh!<clsr>
Not here!<>

Lord Ledin!<clsr>
Anzel Fortress has fallen...<>

Al.. Albert...<>

Yaaaaaa!
How can you waste time with such
a little fortress like this?<clsr>
I'll show you how it's done!<>

Shit!
I won't be defeated!<>

N-No way!<clsr>
Guwaaa!<>

Damn!
Our attack failed.<clsr>
Let's withdraw for now!<>

Albert!<clsr>
Albert, are you here?!<>

I'm here, prince.<>

Are you all right?<clsr>
It would be difficult for us to
bring an injured man.<>

They barely managed to scratch me.<>

According to the messenger from
reconnaissance, it seems the enemy
has begun to retreat.<>

OK, let's head after them!<>

land!<>

Come on, prepare yourself!<>

Guhuu!<>

Taste the power of our cavalry!<>

Die!<>

H-How regrettable...<>

You think you assholes have what
it takes to beat me?!<clsr>
I have news for you, you don't!<>

This... this is fate...<>

Impudent fools!<>

Gwaaaah!<>

Go!<>

Glory to the Dalshis Empire
forever!<clsr>
It's my time to visit Davey Jones's
Locker...<>

I hope you're prepared...<>

Damn!<clsr>
I'll be back to defeat you later!<>

Are you trying to flee!?<>

Shit!<>

Just retreat!<clsr>
If you continue this
foolishness, you'll die!<>

O-OK..<>
