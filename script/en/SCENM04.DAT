So this is the Forest of Death...
It seems like we're in pretty
deep.<>

Prince, this forest is dangerous.
We need to cross it as soon as
possible.<>

I guess so.<clsr>
But have you noticed? Something
seems odd...<clsr>
Like we're being watched.<>

We're in trouble!<clsr>
We've been surrounded by monsters!<>

What?!
Everyone form up! Prepare to
defend!<>

They're coming!<clsr>
Look out!<>

Ordinary attacks won't hurt
these creatures!<>

Don't let your troops spread
out! Stay close together!<>

These things are weak against
fire!<clsr>
All troops charge! Let's crush
them!<>

Lord Ledin!<clsr>
We're here to help you!<>

Chris?!
Why did you follow us here?!<>

The monsters are trying to escape!<>

We're saved.
But why did the monsters...<>

Lord Ledin.<clsr>
It's safe now!<>

Thank you, if it weren't for your
help, I dare not think what could
have become of us.<>

I talked with Thorn about
following you.<clsr>
Hawking was worried about you
crossing the forest alone, so he
asked us to help you.<>

I am again in his debt.<>

Lord Ledin.<clsr>
In thanks for protecting them
from the thieves, the people of
Salrath wanted you to have
this Cross.<>

Um... Ledin...<clsr>
I really want to be able to fight
alongside you in this battle.<>

No, it's too dangerous! I couldn't
see you injured for my sake.<>

Please!<clsr>
I... ummm... please.<clsr>
I promise I won't get in your
way...<>

... I see...<clsr>
... all right then, Chris.<clsr>
From now on, I'll be glad to have
you with us.<>

Thank you!<>

Obtained a Devil Axe!<>

Obtained a Chain Mail!<>

What's going on?!<clsr>
Ordinary monsters shouldn't have
been able to plan an ambush like
this...!<>

After making it so close to
Baldea, can I really be finished
in such a place...<>

Nrgh...<>

I'm severely injured...<clsr>
Prince, I must retreat for now.<>

We won't fall prey to this
Forest of Death!<>

I can't go on.
The rest is up to you!<>

Let's roast these bastards!<>

Yeah!<>

Eh? These guys don't look
so tough to me.<clsr>
Let's make soup out of them!<>

Even if we know their weakness,
will it be any use?<>

Lord Ledin!<clsr>
Please leave the Gels to us!<>

I'm sorry Chris...<clsr>
Everyone, reinforcements are here!
Hold strong!<>

Eww! This is so disgusting!
They're all slimy!<clsr>
And they're coming this way!!!<>

Eeeeeew! They're so sticky!<clsr>
This feels gross!<>

Chris, that's enough!<clsr>
Leave the rest to me!<>

OK!<>

BSHOOOOO!<>

BSHOOOOO!<>

BSHOOOOO!<>

BSHOOOOO!<>

BSHOOOOO!<>

All the monsters are beaten!<clsr>
Let's head on to Baldea castle
as fast as possible!<>

All the monsters are beaten!<clsr>
Let's head on to Baldea castle
as fast as possible!<>

All right!<clsr>
Let's defeat Digos's troops and
retake the castle!<clsr>
But this was a hard fight.<clsr>
It was Chris and Thorn's helps
that saw us through it.<>

We had to find you.<clsr>
Hawking was worried about you
crossing the forest alone, so he
asked us to aid you.<>

Prince!<>

Lord Ledin!<clsr>
