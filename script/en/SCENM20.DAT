This is the deepest part of the
temple.<>

Ahh, the humans.
It's quite impressive that you've
made it this far.<>

Böser!<clsr>
Your defeat is at hand!
I can't allow you to revive
the dark god!<>

Ha ha ha!<clsr>
Nothing can stop me from reviving
the powerful darkness!
Feeble mortals like you are
little more than a nuisance.<clsr>
Are you really foolish enough to
fight me?
Sit back and watch, runts!<clsr>
WA HA HA HA!<>

This all ends NOW!
Troops, charge!!!<>

Watch closely, for this is the
day darkness shall once again
be sealed!<>

Come on, I won't hold back!
Witness my true strength!<>

Terrible... I was just one step
short...<>

I'll win this battle for sure!<>

How could I be injured at a time
like this...<clsr>
I'm beaten.<>

Conceited bastard!
How dare you turn your blade
at me!<>

Damn... please win this fight
for me!<>

Huh?!<>

Shriek---!<clsr>
L-Ledin....!<>

Fall back! You're too injured to
continue this fight!<clsr>
I can't see you die!<>

O-OK!<>

Don't think you're going to get
away from me!<>

Bilge!
How can I be beaten by such
salts...!<clsr>
Sorry, a retreat I must make!<>

I won't let myself be defeated
here!<>

I did the best I could...<clsr>
Maybe it's time for me to rest for
a while...!<>

Your evil ambition ends here!<>

I can't go on...
Everyone... I'm sorry!<>

Break through them!<>

It's useless...
This time I am beaten.<>

I won't let you go any further!<>

I won't die!<clsr>
I... won't...
guh... guwaa!<>

What fools! Do you think we'll
ever allow you to live if you
oppose our dark god?<>

God of darkness!
I offer you my life!<>

Prepare yourself!<>

You think you can defeat me?<clsr>
Sorry children, but you are
wasting your lives!<clsr>
HA HA HA HA HA...<>

Follow our plan!<>

Kuh... how could I be beaten...<clsr>
Gwaaa!<>

Do you think to defeat me?!<>

Even if you defeat me, your
destiny ends here...<clsr>
Guyaa!<>

Take this! Die!!!<>

God of darkness!<clsr>
I call on you to give these
people a hideous death!<>

God, grant me your dark power!<>

Come, mortals!
Taste our full power upon
your flesh!<>

Return to the darkness from
whence you came, Böser!<>

Hah! You're too late.<clsr>
Now, the seal that bound the powers
of darkness has already
been broken!<clsr>
FWA HA HA HA HA...<>

W-What?!<clsr>
What's this vibration?<>

Impossible!<clsr>
I'm... I'm...
Uwaaaaah!<>

My name is Chaos.<clsr>
The time has come to fulfill my
mission in this world.<>

Th-This is the source of the
dark powers?!<>

Th-This is the source of the
dark powers?!<>

Since the beginning, my purpose
has been to create chaos and
conflict in the world of man.<>

And for what purpose?<>

To prevent stagnation.<clsr>
Without conflict, without war,
without strife, this world can
not continue to evolve.<>

I won't let you do it!<>

I won't let you do it!<>

I cannot permit any who oppose me
to live in this world.<clsr>
I will destroy anything which
prevents me from serving my
purpose.<>

You think you can?!<clsr>
Demon! I'll seal you once again
with Langrisser!<>

Descendant of light who bears
Langrisser!<clsr>
I warn you now, it is not
possible to stop me.<clsr>
But should you wish to follow
your ancestors, so be it.<clsr>
Come forth!<>

I'll destroy you!<>

This is the end!<clsr>
Vanish into the flow of eternity,
Chaos!<>

There is no time when I shall
ever disappear or cease to exist.<>

What?!<>

This only one of the times I have
manifested in this world.<clsr>
Since times too ancient for man
to remember, I have existed to
guide this world into conflict.<>

Then... what has our battle been
for... what of the world...!?<>

Mankind will never bend to the
power of chaos.
We are led by laws.<>

True, the power of man's laws and
willingness to follow them has
led the world to stability.<clsr>
However, when stability is
achieved, stagnation begins.<clsr>
Nothing is born from something
that does not move and progress.<>

So you are saying chaos is a
necessary element of creation?<>

Exactly.<clsr>
But humans continue to battle the
power of chaos for foolish
personal desires.<>

We're different than that!<>

Hear me.<clsr>
Humans are the only creatures
which possess the powers of both
order and chaos.<clsr>
Order is reflected by the light
and chaos by the dark.<>

Are you... really a god?<>

Little girl.
The answer to that question lies
within your heart.<clsr>
If you believe a god recognizes
order and seeks chaos to destroy
balance, then yes.<clsr>
My power will appear in this
world once again.<clsr>
But for now, the scales have
tilted in your favor.<clsr>
My time for another rest has
come.<clsr>
Farewell... descendants of light.<>
