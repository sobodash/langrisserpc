King Isaac!
The castle has been surrounded!<>

Ledin, you must escape to Salrath.<clsr>
Our ally, Hawking, will be able to
send us aid.<clsr>
Follow Narm out of the castle.
Now hurry!<>

Father!
What are you saying?!
You can't fight alone!<>

You have to gather more troops.
The castle can't hold like this
for long.<clsr>
We'll be all right.<>

Arrr, they be makin' their move!<>

Volkoff, please look after Ledin.<>

Yes, sire!
I shall guard him with my life.<>

My prince! You must hurry before
the enemy arrives!<>

You can't waste any time!
Hurry and follow Narm out of the
castle!<clsr>
Get going!<>

Make sure to treat any injured
troops immediately. We can't afford
any casualties!<>

Yes sir!<>

Commanders aren't invincible
either. Make sure to heal when
you need to.<>

I understand, your majesty.<>

Take care not to get killed!<>

You can be sure of that!<>

Make haste, Ledin!<>

Father...<>

My prince, please hurry!<>

What are you doing, Ledin?!<clsr>
Everyone is fighting to protect
you, would you waste their lives?<>

My prince, it's dangerous to
continue this battle!<clsr>
Please, come here quickly!<>

Ledin, hurry and go!<>

Ledin, I'll guide you to safety.<>

But I'm worried about my father...<>

After getting you to safety, I'll
return to the castle and help the
king.<>

Thank you, Narm.<clsr>
After getting reinforcements in
Salrath, I'll surely return.<>

This is the end...<clsr>
Father... everyone... I'm sorry...<>

I've been gravely wounded.
My prince, I must retreat.<>

Ledin, quickly!
Escape to safety!<>

Avast! I be Captain Taylor!<clsr>
Remember it, for it be the last
name your landlubbin' ears ever
hear!<>

Lord Taylor!<clsr>
If you continue to fight in that
condition, it would be beyond
rash!<>

Lay off, savvy?
There's still fight in these
bones!<clsr>
Die! Damn you!<>

For Lady Jessica!
Let's show them our bravery,
we can't die here!<>

This is too much, I won't let
you continue this assault!<>

Ah...!<>

Someone! Cover Lady Jessica.
The enemies are coming from
the rear.<>

Prince!<>

Hurry Ledin, over here!<>

My prince!
Make haste! We're surrounded
by the enemy!<>

Lady Narm!<>

Urk!<clsr>
Un... till the prince comes...
I... can't fall...<>

Narm!!!<>

Kossel, you're not young
anymore!
Don't push yourself!<>

I'll be OK.<clsr>
These kids have a ways to go
before they can match my
experience.<>

This will be tough on you!
I may be old, but I'm
not new to the battlefield<>

Priest!<>

Ungh!<clsr>
All I wanted was one more
year...<>

It's dangerous here.<clsr>
Hurry and retreat!<>

Oh, I'm sorry...<>

Have a taste of our power!<clsr>
Troops, seize the castle!<>

Shit...<clsr>
How dare you mock my strength!<>

I'll have to retreat... but
I won't forget about this battle!<>

Stop wasting my time,
Just surrender already!<>

Ha ha ha ha haaaa!<>

You...<clsr>
Shit! I gotta pull out...
This battle isn't decided yet!<>

You must have some real guts
to try and confront me!<>

Lord Digos, I've failed you...<>

Arrr, ya'll be some ignorant
fuckers, ain'cha?<>

For the glory of the
Dalshis Empire!<>

Ignorant fool!
Why do you even bother trying
to resist me?!<>

It's indeed impressive that
you managed to best me.<clsr>
However. backup troops are on
standby and awaiting the second
strike.<clsr>
So then, I'll be back soon.
Count on it...<clsr>
Ha ha ha ha ha!<>

We may have repelled them for
now, but their second wave will
attack soon.<clsr>
I must to hurry to Lord Hawking
to gather reinforcements from
Salrath.<>

We can't waste any more time!<clsr>
Let's crush them in one fell
swoop!<>

Have their main forces already
started to move?!<>

Digos! You fiend!
Langrisser shall never be yours!<>
