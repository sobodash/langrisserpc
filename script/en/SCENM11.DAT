We're here, it's the Twin Castle
of Emperor Digos!<>

Digos should be somewhere inside
these walls.<>

OK, our aim may be Emperor Digos
alone!<clsr>
But don't ignore the other
soldiers!<>

Ohhh? Is that little Prince Ledin
I see over there?<clsr>
As I recall, when we stormed your
precious castle, you scurried off
alone and left all your friends
to die.<clsr>
He he he...<>

Prince, don't listen to that man.<clsr>
He needs to learn some manners.<>

Will you so carelessly throw away
your life?<clsr>
If that's the case, then come
here!<>

Tsk, think you can reach the
Emperor, do you?<clsr>
Ledin, our last match was a nice
warm-up but now it's time for
the finale!<>

KISHAAAA!<>

?!
More monsters have appeared?!<>

Impossible?!<clsr>
Are they're trying to attack the
castle too?!<>

Lance!
Courage is one thing but to
continue like this is suicide!<>

Do you jest?!
I eat weaklings like these for
breakfast.<clsr>
Wait your turn!<>

A strange object quickly darted
across the sky.<clsr>
After passing, something
fell to the ground.<clsr>
Obtained a Rune Stone!<>

I won't be stopped now!<>

You damn fools!<clsr>
He he he he...<>

To have fallen before Digos...<>

I'll never let you stop me from
reaching Emperor Digos!<>

Augh!<>

After coming this far,
there's no way I'll turn back!<>

Shit!<clsr>
You're going to have to go on
without me!<>

Hyaaaa!<>

Kyaa!<>

What a pain in the ass!<>

God damn it!<clsr>
How the fuck can I lose to
this guy?!<>

I'll never give up the fight!<>

How can you continue to fight?!<clsr>
Back off!<>

Take this!<>

It's no use!<>

Let's go!<>

To die in such a wretched place...<>

Oh ho, and who do you think you
are?!<>

Emperor Digos, please help---<clsr>
Guhaa...!<>

Witness the power of my magic!<>

Aaah...<clsr>
The sky... it looks so...
high...<>

Come at me as you please, you'll
never defeat me!<>

Kuh, I'm helpless.<clsr>
Wait for me, youngster from
Baldea!<>

BURN! BLAZE! SMOLDER!<>

Gyaaa<>

Passing here will cost you
dearly!<>

Most impressive, ladies and
gentlemen of Baldea.
You've managed to best me...<>

GYSHEEEE!<>

GYSHEEEE!<>

GYSHEEEE!<>

Someone like you isn't fit to be
my enemy!<clsr>
Die! God damn you, DIE!<>

Aaargh!<>

Lance, that's enough!<clsr>
With that injury, there's no way
you can continue to fight!<>

You think to show me mercy?!
Never have I been so insulted.<>

There's no need to continue this
useless battle!<clsr>
We will defeat Digos and
retrieve Langrisser at any cost.<>

You bastard, how can someone
like you ever hope to defeat
his majesty?<>

If we don't recover Langrisser,
there can never be peace.<clsr>
Because the seal of Langrisser
has been broken, monsters are
awakening in our land!<>

......<clsr>
I don't believe you.<>

Captain!
Are you OK?!<clsr>
Please come here, hurry!<>

...<>

Captain!<>

It's OK, without great power,
there will never be peace.<clsr>
Langrisser has that power!<clsr>
His majesty desired power to
bring an end to the wars.<clsr>
For that purpose alone he sought
Langrisser.<clsr>
His majesty has always been the
epitome of righteousness.<clsr>
I will never believe he can be
defeated by people like you.
Farewell.<>

Lance...<>

Digos is on the top floor!<clsr>
We have to recover Langrisser!<>

The time for our final battle
with Digos is at hand!<>

So many swabs have died for his
cause.<clsr>
Ho... be we really able to stop
him?<>

Come on, let's hurry!<>

Lord Ledin, there appears to be
two entrances.<>

OK. Let's divide up into two
groups.<clsr>
Digos has to be on the top floor.<>

W-Wait!!
You damn cowards!<>
