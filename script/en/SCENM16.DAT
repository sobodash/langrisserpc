That damn dragon, it must have
escaped here in quite a panic...<>

This cave seems a little odd,
have you noticed anything...?<>

Maybe it's the beast's nesting
grounds.<>

Well anyway, let's move out!<>

I'm a little worried. This
dragon is a strong foe indeed.
He won't go down easily!<>

How cruel...
For the dragon to have
killed someone like that...<clsr>
Hmm?!<clsr>
This must be the legendary
Dragon Slayer!<clsr>
The sword used by the hero...<clsr>
Rest warrior, I'll take over
your mission and see the beast
is slain once and for all.<>

How cruel... this looks like
the handiwork of a dragon.<clsr>

Obtained the Dragon Slayer<>

Obtained a Rune Stone!<>

Obtained a Rune Stone!<>

Obtained the Crown!<>

I'll break you!<>

I knew it, going after a dragon
like this was a BAD idea!<>

Let's go!<>

To be done in this way...<>

Come at me!<>

Shit!
My weapon has had it!
You'll have to handle the rest.<>

Yaaaa!<>

Lord Leeeedin!<>

CHRIS!<clsr>
That's enough! Fall back!<>

Gangway, swabs!<>

Ku, I've failed...<>

Prepare yourself!<>

It's useless...<>

I won't let you get away!<>

It seems I was careless...<>

Receive my blade!<>

I'm sorry prince,
the rest is in your hands.<>

Don't thrust randomly if you
get surrounded.<clsr>
A single hit is better than
twenty missed.<>

Fuu... how foolish. <>

How could you believe me
defeated?!<>

GISHAAAA!<>

KISHAAAA!<>

It's defeated at last...<>

The sword....<clsr>
The Dragon Slayer...
vanished...?<>

Prince, what are you saying...?<>

Prince, what are you saying...?<>

That sword was a manifestation
of the hero's will...<>

Perhaps with the dragon defeated
and its purpose served,
its existence came to an end...<>

How sad...<>

At any rate, that slate we found
before seems to be written

What is this?!<clsr>
It looks like an ancient record
of the Baldea Kingdom!<clsr>
"When the evil lord Böser
released the powers of darkness,
a shadow was cast over the
entire world.."<clsr>
"When this happened, King Zieghart
of Elthlead led an army of light
to clash with the army of
darkness..."<clsr>
"With Langrisser, the darkness
was returned to Velzeria
from whence it came, to dwell
forever in nothingness..."<>

Velzeria...<clsr>
Could it be the source of the
evil we now face?<>

Then, my prince!<>

Then, my prince!<>

To strike down the darkness
and restore the seal...<clsr>
This is our mission...
the mission of Baldea!<clsr>
We must invade Velzeria with
every last soldier we have!<>

GYSHAAA!<>

God damn you, you bastard...<>

BWOOON!<>
