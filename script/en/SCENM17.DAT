Welcome, descendants of Elthlead.<>

Who's there?! Who are you?!<>

My name is Böser.<clsr>
I'm the lord of Velzeria, no,
now of this entire world.<>

What the hell?!<clsr>
Mankind is free, how can you
claim control over this world?<>

Hmmmmm? Well that would be because
of a thing called "power."<clsr>
Nicolis, Nagya, do be kind and
entertain our guests for a
while!<>

As you command.<clsr>
I guess I'll let them see a
little of my magic.<clsr>
Oh ye who dwells within
the darkness of the void...
Lord of lies and death.<clsr>
I swear my soul to walk
the path of darkness,
An awaiting vessel
for your vast powers!<clsr>
Suecia Nuel Kaos.
Mulvi Ricohn!<>

Aaah!
My head...<>

Aaah!
My head...<>

Aaah!
My head...<>

Aaah!
My head...<>

?!
What's wrong?!<>

He he heee...
That would be the curse of
visions.<clsr>
Your companion should have no
qualm about murdering you now.
He he hee...<>

You can't get away with this!<>

I can't believe I'd fall here...<>

Prepare yourself!<>

This is most unexpected...<>

This will finish you!<>

Shit!<clsr>
I'm done for, you'll have to
carry on without me!<>

Yaaa!<>

Kyaaa!<>

Damn you!<>

God damn it!<>

My prince, I have an idea.<clsr>
If you can defeat Nicolis,
there's a chance it may break his
spell.<>

I understand.<clsr>
In that case let's hurry after
Nicolis!<>

!?<>

You cannot break my enchantment...<>

I've come this far, I won't
run away!<>

Please see to the rest!<>

Let's go!<>

My prince, I've failed you.<clsr>
I must retreat at once.<>

Leave Nicolis's buddies to me.<clsr>
Hurry and seal their powers!<>

I won't let you return alive!<>

Damn!<clsr>
Is this the end?<>

GUGAAAA!<>

GIEEEEE!<>

GUGAAAA!<>

GIEEEEE!<>

GUGAAAA!<>

GIEEEEE!<>

GUGAAAA!<>

GIEEEEE!<>

GUGAAAA!<>

GIEEEEE!<>

Don't bother coming out if you're
not planning to fight seriously.<>

Don't waste your time trying to
break my enchantment.<clsr>
There no way you can defeat me.<>

You... you broke my spell...<clsr>
Shit! I won't forget this!<>

?!
I... what am I doing here?<>

You're OK now!<clsr>
You were under one of Nicolis's
spells.<>

Eh?!<clsr>
What am I doing over here?<>

You're okay now!<clsr>
You were under one of Nicolis's
spells.<>

UHYA HYA HYA!<clsr>
Go and murder everyone!
Hee hee hee...<>

Do you understand the power
of our god yet?!<clsr>
Resistance is like trying to hold
back the tide!<>

Ugyaa!<clsr>
Damn it, I'm going to
beat you next time for sure!<clsr>
Just you wait!<>

Directing your sword at me is
foolish indeed.<>

For a human you've done quite
well.<clsr>
But we will meet again.<>

The time has come for you to
make a choice.<clsr>
Up till now I've given you the
opportunity to flee and spare
your lives.<clsr>
But should you persist, I will
eagerly await you in the
underground sanctuary.<>

Quickly! We're only a little
way from Velzeria Castle!<clsr>
Let's move out!<>

Yes sir!<>

Yes sir!<>

Böser!<clsr>
The time is at hand!
We'll defeat you and seal you and
your henchmen once again with
Langrisser!<>
