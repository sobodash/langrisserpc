Prince, we have a serious problem!<clsr>
An enormous dragon is heading
right at us!<>

We need to keep it outside the town!
Evacuate the citizens, quickly!<>

If we're all that's in its way...
the dragon will easily be able to
enter the town.<>

Lord Ledin.<>

What is it, priest?<>

The spirit of the great flame
is said to rest in the mountain
north-west of this village.<clsr>
With its help, we may be able to
battle the dragon on more equal
footing...<>

I see, then let's try to solicit
its assistance...<>

The dragon has crossed the
shoreline!<>

Shit!
Can't we stop these guys?!<>

The dragon is heading right for
the town!<clsr>
We have to find a way to stop it!<>

Are you trying to escape?!<>

Is this the end...?<>

Take this, you damn monster!<>

Impressive...
You'd make a great sparring
partner.<>

Uryaaa!<>

Shit!<clsr>
It's all up to you now!<>

I'll try my hardest too!<>

Kyaa!<>

Ho, me hearties! This be more fun
than a barrel of grog!<>

That was a bit too much...<clsr>
I think I'm done for this battle...<>

Your assault ends here!<>

Ah...<>

Die!<>

Kuuu....<>

Let's go!<>

Oh no!<>

Don't think you can return alive!<>

It seems...
... I am beaten...<>

You think you can do as you
please in this village?!<>

Shit! I'm trapped!<>

Muu... how regrettable...<>

Cursed bastard!<>

How could I have been....<clsr>
It looks like my final
farewell is at hand...<>

Kyaaa!<clsr>
You demons!<>

Kyaaa!<clsr>
Mommy!<>

Ah!
The flame giant is moving!<>

Ah!
The flame giant is moving!<>

Ah!
The flame giant is moving!<>

KISHAAAA!<>

Come hither.<clsr>
Your powers are nothing to my
inferno!<>

I'll burn you to ash!<>

That was all I had...<clsr>
It looks like my time to enter
the spirit world has come...<>

GUWAAAA!<>

GIEEEE!<>

GIEEEE!<>

GUWAAAA!<>

HYA HYA HYA HYA!!<clsr>
Good, good!
Burn up the whole town!
Murder everyone!<>

KISHAAAA!<>

That makes twice
you've shamed me.<clsr>
I won't forget about this!<>

He who burns red as the sun!
Oh great spirit of flame!<clsr>
I ask that you lend us your
strength!<>

Who is it that disturbs my slumber?<>

I am the prince of Baldea, Ledin.<clsr>
This town is being attacked by
a great dragon.<clsr>
It had such unyielding power!<>

Baldea...<clsr>
I see, then you are a
descendant of Elthlead...<clsr>
In that case, I will help you.<>

The dragon is escaping!<>

The dragon is escaping!<>

This is our chance!<clsr>
Now that it's weakened, we can
follow and finish it for good!<>

Yes sir!<>

Yes sir!<>

Prince, take this.<>

Obtained a Rune Stone!<>

But the dragon appeared with
Nagya...<clsr>
Is it possible that he was the
one controlling it?<>

That may be so.<clsr>
Normally, the demons would never
attack people in such small
groups.<>

I wonder, where are these evil
creatures coming from...?<clsr>
Oh, by the way, Jessica, what is
this thing called Elthlead?<>

That's what the kingdom of Baldea
was called in ancient times.<>

I see...<>

So, who will join us in stopping
the dragon?<>

The town...<clsr>
The town is burning...<>

GARUUU!<>

WOOOON!<>
