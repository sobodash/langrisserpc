Lord Ledin!
The enemy is trapped! <>

They'll be difficult to catch if
they try to escape into the deep
forest.<clsr>
We have to hurry after them!<>

I see.<clsr>
We have to hold back their
commander! Let's circle around
and crush them!<clsr>
Everyone, let's move out!<>

That damn Bernoulli!
He couldn't take even a single
stronghold.<clsr>
We can't afford further conflict,
we must retreat!<>

Shit, we're in trouble!<clsr>
A party of enemies are pursuing
us!<>

Damn it!!!
If we're caught here we'll be
completely wiped out!<clsr>
Third and fourth units, secure
the retreat of our main force!<>

Yes sir!<>

Main forces, ready yourselves for
a full retreat on my signal!<clsr>
Anyone who falls behind will be
left behind!<>

The enemies are bustling, something
must be up!<>

Bilge!
Avast, me hearties, we've been
spotted!<>

All troops, RETREAT!!!<>

The enemy is fleeing into the
the forest to the north-west!
Don't let them escape!<>

Secure our allies' retreat!<>

We'll take over from here!
Continue your Retreat!<>

Thank you.<clsr>
Everyone, we're almost to the
forest!
We can't give up!<>

Enemy reinforcements have
arrived!<>

Lance?!<clsr>
Men, don't falter!
We must break through!<>

Hurry! They're escaping!<clsr>
Use all your strength to stop
them!<>

Not a chance!
You won't stop us no matter what!<>

Just a little further!<clsr>
If we can just cross this river,
our escape is assured!
Men, make haste!<>

Yes sir!<>

This is bad!<clsr>
If they cross the river, we may
lose their trail for good!<>

Wa ha ha ha ha!<clsr>
Pursuing us like this is a waste!
Why don't you just give up?<>

Somehow we managed to carve out
a path for our escape...<clsr>
All right! Everyone, let's go!<>

Ledin!
This time, the day is mine!
Ha ha!<clsr>
Farewell!<>

Lance, you bastard...<clsr>
Why are you here...?<>

Damn!
We're letting them get away...<>

Obtained the Masayan Sword!<>

They're escaping!<>

You and the others, your lives
will end here!<>

Lance, damn you...<clsr>
What the hell are YOU doing
here...?<>

I can't pursue them any
further...<clsr>
Everyone... I'm sorry...!<>

Have you realized yet what a
fool you are to resist US?<clsr>
Uwa ha ha ha ha ha haaa!<>

Prince!
Please see to the rest!<>

Guh...
Not bad...!<>

Anyone so brazen as to turn
their sword against me shall
perish!<>

Shit!
My sword is not long for this
battlefield...<clsr>
I leave the rest to you!<>

Aaah!<>

Kyaa!<>

This corsair will never let ye
get away!<>

Shit!<clsr>
Are we to be defeated as well?<>

I won't let you escape!!<>

I can't go on any more.<clsr>
I have to retreat, for now...<>

These guys have almost made it
into the forest!<clsr>
We can't waste any more time!
Hit them hard and fast!<>

I must hold out...<>

...Guhh!<>

Impudent fools!<>

Wh-Why?!<clsr>
Guah!<>

Damn it!
I can't be defeated here!<>

Guaah!<>

Nuuoooooo!<>

Persistent bastards!<clsr>
I'll have my revenge yet!<>

The Da....
...Dalshis... Empire...
FOREVER!<>

We've been wiped out...<clsr>
Ledin, mark my words!
The day will come when I see
you on your knees!<clsr>
Prepare yourself, for when we
next meet, I shall see you fall.<>

It seems like it's finally
over...<>

Prince, we've received word from
our troops in Baldea!<clsr>
Preparations are complete for
the invasion of the Dalshis
Empire!<>

I see...<clsr>
Digos... you'd best hold onto your
head... while it's still attached
to your shoulders.<clsr>
The day shall come when your death
is realized, this I swear!<>

This shall be the last victory
you ever see!<clsr>
Let's go, Laias!<>

Yes sir, captain!<>

Feh!
You move too slow!<>

Damn!<>

Curses!<clsr>
My steed is fallen...!<>

I won't be beaten here!<>

Unh... my legs...<>

Back off, Laias!<>
