Eeeh? You STILL aren't dead?!<clsr>
Form up for a stronger attack!
Crush that bastard!<>

Yes sir!<>

Looks like these guys are
getting serious...<>

It's no good!
We're too outnumbered!<clsr>
If we continue like this we'll
be wiped out!<>

Quit your bitching!
The prince will come to help
us for sure!<clsr>
Just do your best till then!<>

Who is that defending Anzel
Fortress?<>

It looks like Albert and his
company.<>

Amazing, I can't believe he's held
out this long.<>

All right!
Let's drive these guys out!<>

I wonder how much longer Albert
can hold that line?<>

Hurry up!<clsr>
We need to help Albert as soon
as possible!<>

Ledin!<clsr>
I'll pay you back for the
humiliation I suffered
earlier!<>

Is that Lance?
Damn, not again.<>

That's right!
I told you I was only retreating
temporaily.<clsr>
Let's go!<>

It's the prince!<clsr>
The prince himself came to help!
Everyone! We just need to hold
out a little longer!<>

Wait for me, Albert!<clsr>
I'll be there to help you soon!<>

Wait for me, Albert!<clsr>
I'm coming to help you right now!<>

Out of my way!<>

Sorry, Albert...
It seems I've fallen early...<>

I won't let you do as you please
from here on!<>

Aaaah!<>

Narm, back off!<>

If you don't want to die,
get the hell out of my way!<>

Shit!
My arm has had it!<clsr>
I'm leaving the rest up to you!<>

Albert is in danger, we have
to hurry!<>

This isn't good!<>

Eeeeek!<>

My name was famous as a pirate!
I'll show you why!<>

Damn!
There guys aren't going down
without a fight, are they?<>

I won't let you!<>

Aaaah!<>

You mustn't falter! <clsr>
Don't fall back even one step!
We have to hold out till the
prince arrives!<>

Lord Albert!<clsr>
We can't hold out any more!<>

Damn, I'm helpless.<clsr>
If I'm going down I'm taking
you with me!<>

Not yet!
I won't be defeated yet!<>

Guhh!<clsr>
Not here!<>

Lord Ledin!<clsr>
Anzel Fortress has fallen...<>

down.<>

has begun to retreat.<>
