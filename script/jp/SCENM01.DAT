King Isacc!
The castle has been surrounded!<>

Ledin, you must escape to Salrath.<clsr>
Our ally, Hawking, is there.<clsr>
Follow Narm out of the castle.
Now hurry!<>

Father!
What are you saying?!
You can't fight alone!<>

You have to gather more troops.
The castle can't hold like this
for long.<clsr>
We'll be all right.<>

Sire, the enemy is on the move!<>

Volkoff, please look after Ledin.<>

Yes, sire!
I shall guard him with my life.<>

My prince! You must hurry before
the enemy arrives!<>

You can't waste any time!
Hurry and go to Narm! <clsr>
Now, move!<>

Make sure to treat any injured
troops imediatly. We can't afford
any casualties!<>

Yes sir!<>

Commanders aren't invincible
either. Make sure to heal
when you need to.<>

I understand, your majesty.<>

Take care not to get killed!<>

Not a chance!<>

Make haste, Ledin!<>

Father...<>

My prince, please hurry!<>

What are you doing, Ledin?!<clsr>
Everyone is fighting to protect you,
would you waste their lives?<>

My prince, it's dangerous to
continue this battle!<clsr>
Please, come here quickly!<>

Ledin, hurry and go!<>

Ledin, I'll guide you to
safety.<>

But I'm worried about my father...<>

After getting you to safety,
I'll return to the castle to
help the king.<>

Thank you, Narm.<clsr>
After getting reinforcements in
Salrath, I'll surely return.<>

This is the end...<clsr>
Father... everyone... I'm sorry...<>

I've been hurt pretty bad.
My prince, I have to retreat.<>

Ledin, quickly!
Escape to safety!<>

My name is Taylor!
Remember it, because this is as
far as you go!<>

Lord Taylor!<clsr>
If you continue to fight in
that condition, it would be
beyond rash!<>

Get off of me!
I can still fight!<clsr>
Die! Damn you!<>

For Lady Jessica!
Show them our bravery,
we can't die here!<>

This is too much, I won't let
you continue this assault!.<>

Ah...!<>

Someone! Cover lady Jessica.
The enemies will be coming from
the rear.<>

Prince!<>

Hurry Ledin, over here!<>

My prince!
Make haste! We're surrounded
by the enemy!<>

Lady Narm!<>

Urk!<clsr>
Un... till the prince comes...
I... can't fall...<>

Narm!!!<>

Cossel, you're not young
anymore!
Don't push yourself!<>

I'll be ok.<clsr>
These kids have a ways to go
before they'll ever be as
experienced as me.<>

This will be tough on you!
I may be old, but I'm
not new to the battlefield<>

Priest!<>

Ungh!<clsr>
All I wanted was one more
year...<>

It's dangerous here.<clsr>
Hurry and retreat!<>

Oh, I'm sorry...<>

Have a taste of our power!<clsr>
Take the castle!<>

Shit...<clsr>
How dare you
mock my power!<>

We'll have to retreat!<clsr>
I won't forget about this battle!<>

Stop wasting my time,
Just surrender already!<>

Ha ha ha ha haaaa!<>

You...<clsr>
Fuck! Gotta pull out...
This battle isn't decided yet!<>

You must have some real guts
to try and confront me!<>

Lord Digos, I've failed you...<>

Feh! You are some ignorant
fuckers, aren't ya'!<>

For the glory of the
Dalshis Empire!<>

Ignorant fool!
Why do you even bother trying
to resist me?!<>

It's quite impressive that
you managed to best me.<clsr>
However. backup troops are on
standby and awaiting the second
strike.<clsr>
So then, I'll be back later.
Count on it...<clsr>
Ha ha ha ha ha!<>

We may have repelled them for
now, but their second wave will
attack soon.<clsr>
I must to hurry to Lord Hawking
to gather reinforcements from
Salrath.<>

We can't waste any more time!<clsr>
Let's crush them in one fell
swoop!<>

Have their main forces already
started to move?!<>

Digos! You son of a bitch!
Langrisser shall never be yours!<>
