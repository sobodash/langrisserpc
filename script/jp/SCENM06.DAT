This is Baldea castle!<>

Volkoff, I wish you could have
seen it once more...<>

Prince...<>

All right!<clsr>
Let's go, I won't quit now!<>

The enemy is on the move!<>

It's looks like they finally
made their way back here.<clsr>
What a fool, he'll meet his end
here!<>

Your will shall be carried out!<>

Father, Volkoff...<clsr>
Please watch over us in this
battle.<>

I'll take back this castle!<>

This castle used to be your home.
And now, it will be your grave!
Ha ha ha ha ha!<>

The king and Volkoff's enemies,
I'll kill you all!<>

I can't let you have your way!<>

Uwah!!<clsr>
Th-This is the end...<>

Lady Narm, that's enough!<clsr>
Please retreat and leave the rest
to me!<>

I didn't come this far just to
run away!<>

SHIT!<clsr>
These guys are REALLY good!<>

Retreat!
Leave the rest to me!<>

This is Lord Ledin's castle...<clsr>
We'll take it back for sure!<>

Yeah!<>

Eeeek!<>

That's enough Kris! You need
to retreat!<clsr>
Back off right now!<>

will kill you all!<clsr>

I can't believe I was beaten
here...<clsr>
Most impressive... gwaa!
Glory to the Dalshis Empire!<>

Search the castle!<clsr>
We have to free everyone who was
held captive!<>

Prince!<>

Taylor!
You're safe!<>

Having lived though the king
perished is a disgrace...<clsr>
I'm sorry...<>

No, don't worry about it.<>

Lord Ledin.<>

Jessica!<clsr>
Thank god, you're still alive!<>

I have some terrible news for
you!<clsr>
Langrisser was taken by Emperor
Digos!<clsr>
That sword was used to seal away
ancient evils.<clsr>
It could give anyone who unlimited
power to one who knows its
secrets.<>

What are you saying?<clsr>
More importantly, do you know
where the sword was taken?<>

The revival of evil is only
a matter of time now.<>

We have to hurry. Unless we get
back Langrisser, evil will be
unleashed once again.<>

Does Digos know about this?<>

I don't think so, but possibly.<clsr>
Only I should know about this as
the king's court magician.<>

This isn't good.<clsr>
That guy may be planning to use
Langrisser to unleash some evil
power.<>

So then, the next question is how
do we get it back?<>

We'll have to invade Dalshis
immediatly.<>

Father, watch over us.<clsr>
We'll protect the peace of this
world for sure.<>

We've got trouble!<clsr>
Anzel Fortress has just been
attacked by Dalshis troops!<>

What?!
We have to head for Anzel Fortress
at once!<>

Baldean troops, prepare yourselves!<>

I won't let you lay one finger on
General Zeld!<>

I won't forget this!<clsr>
This injury can't keep me out of
battle for long!<>

I won't surrender my life here!<>

I have no regrets...<>

Die!<>

Uwaaa!<>

General Zeld!!<>

Uwaaa!<>

Charge!<>

General Zeld!!<>

I can't be defeated here!<>

General Zeld!!<>
