The enemy is approaching!<>

All right.
All troops, assume formation!<>

Yes sir!<>

Ha ha ha.<clsr>
We'll scatter the last of Baldea's
reamining forces!<>

If we make it past here, Baldea
castle should be within sight.<>

But it seems like the enemy is
expecting us.<>

That may be, but we can't turn
back now!<clsr>
Everyone, be careful not to get
killed!<>

Yeah!<>

Laias, take the right wing.<>

Laetitia, take the left and circle
around behing them.<>

Yes sir!<>

Yes sir, Captain!<>

I'll leave the rest of the
deployment to your command.<clsr>
I'll join you when you meet the
enemy!<>

Aim for the enemy's commander!
If we defeat him, their troops
will scatter!<>

Okay!<>

Impossible... these guys are
really tough...<>

A chance to pick off the rest of
Baldea's troops sounds rather
fun...<>

Everyone, be careful!<>

We have to make it past here!<>

We have to take back Baldea
castle...<>

By my blood, prince Ledin and
everyone will return to Baldea
castle!<>

Let's see what you can do with
a sword!<>

So thats the power of the
Dalshis empire...<>

Lord Ledin, I hope I can be of
some use.<>

Lord Ledin,
I'm sorry for being such trouble.<>

Ah! Not good!<>

It shouldn't be like this...<>

Let's go!<>

Shit!
I can't go on any more.<>

Sigh...
That's it, their destiny ends
with me.<>

Your strength my have caught my
troops off guard.
But I am not impressed.<>

I am the Black Knight,
Lance Kalxath!<clsr>
You worms aren't even fit to
be my enemy!<>

You, who are you?!<>

I'm Ledin.
The prince of Baldea!<>

Well then, for now I must
retreat.<clsr>
Farewell!<>

Wait!<>

My prince!<clsr>
Look out!<>

Ungh!<>

Volkoff!<>

It's a poison arrow!<clsr>
It's an ambush!
The enemy must still be here!
Hurry, find them!<>

Volkoff, are you all right?<clsr>
Hang in there!<>

My prince, I don't think I'll
be following you any more.<>

Wh-What are you saying?!<>

Prince...<clsr>
One day... please take your
throne... and become king...<>

Volkoff!!<clsr>
Open your eyes! Volkoff!!<>

Laias!
That's too much, don't be a fool!<>

I understand, commander!<>

Uwaaaaaaa!<>

Continuing would be foolish!<clsr>
Back off, Laias!
I'll take over from here!<>

Ye, yes sir!<>

You think you can defeat us?!<>

Aaaaah!<>

Laetitia!<clsr>
Don't be a fool, retreat!<>

But I can go on!<>

You only get one life. There
will be other battles.<clsr>
I order you to retreat!<>

Captain Lance...<>

Don't drag this out like a
grudge, this is just fate.<clsr>
Do you want to die!<>

What excelelnt swordsmanship...<clsr>
Gwahhh....<>

We won't be defeated!<>

Glory to the Dalshis Empire
forever!<>
