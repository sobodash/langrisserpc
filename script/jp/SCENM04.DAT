So this is the Forest of the dead...
It seems like we're in pretty
deep.<>

Prince, this forest is dangerous.
We need to get through as soon as
possible.<>

I guess so.<clsr>
But something seems strange, don't
you think?
Like we're being watched.<>

We're in trouble!<clsr>
We've been surrounded by monsters!<>

What?!
Everyone form up! Prepare to
defend!<>

They're coming!<clsr>
Look out!<>

Ordinary attacks won't hurt
these creatures!<>

Don't let your troops spread
out! Stay close together!<>

These things are weak against
fire!<clsr>
All troops charge! Let's kick
their ass!<>

Lord Ledin!<clsr>
We're here to help you!<>

Kris?!
Why did you follow us here?!<>

The monsters are trying to escape!<>

We're saved
But why did the moinsters...<>

Lord Ledin.<clsr>
It's safe now!<>

Thank you, you really saved us.<>

I talked with Thorn about it.<clsr>
Hawking was worried about you
crossing the forest so he asked
us to come help you.<>

That's reassuring.<>

Lord Ledin.<clsr>
In thanks for helping protect them
from the bandits, the people of
Salrath wanted you to have this
cross.<>

Um... Ledin...<clsr>
I really want to fight along side
you in this battle.<>

No, it's too dangerous!<>

Please!<clsr>
I promise I won't get in your
way...<>

... all right then, Kris.<clsr>
From now on your can fight
with us.<>

Thank you!<>

Obtained a Devil Axe!<>

Obtained a Chain Mail!<>

Why?!<clsr>
These guys shouldn't be this smart!<>

After making it so cloase to
Baldea can I really be finished
in a place like this...<>

Nrgh...<>

I've been hurt too bad...<clsr>
Prince, I'm going to have to
retreat.<>

We won't die int his Forest of Death!<>

I can't go on.
The rest is up to you!<>

Let's roast these bastards!<>

Yeah!<>

Huh, these guys don't look
so tough.<clsr>
Let's make soup out of them!<>

Even if we know their weak point,
will it be of any use?<>

Lord Ledin!<clsr>
Please leave the Gels to us!<>

I'm sorry Kris...<clsr>
Reinforcements are here!
Everyone hold strong!<>

Eww! This is so disgusting!<clsr>
They're coming this way!<>

Eeeeeew! They're so sticky!<clsr>
This feels gross!<>

Kris, that's enough!<clsr>
Leave the rest to me!<>

Ok!<>

BSHOOOOO!<>

as fast as possible!<>

All the monsters are beaten!<clsr>
Let's head on to Baldea castle

All right.<clsr>
Let's defeat Digos's troops and
retake the castle!<clsr>
But this was a hard fight.<clsr>
It was Kris and Thorn's helps
that got us through it.<>

We had to find you.<clsr>
Hawking was worried about you
crossing the forest so he asked
us to come help you.<>
