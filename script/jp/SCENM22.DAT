An explanation of this
world's tactics may aid
you on your quest.<>

Would you like an explanation?<>

Very well then, I'll
teach you the basics
of battle tactics.<clsr>
Your units consist 
of commanders and 
soldiers.<clsr>
The commanders are
yourself and your
companions.<clsr>
Soldiers must be
paid for at the
start of every stage.<clsr>
Purchasing troops is
a necessary preparation
before battle.<>

Would you like me to
explain Command Range?<>

When battle actually begins,
try to keep soldiers in the 
vicinity of their commander.<clsr>
The blinking blue area around
the commander is called the
Command Range.<clsr>
Soldiers within this zone
receive a bonus to their 
attack and defense ratings.<clsr>
It is very dangerous for a
soldier unit to enter combat
when outside the range.<>

Would you like me to explain
troop HP recovery?<>

A unit adjacent to its commander
will recover 3 HP at the start
of every turn.<clsr>
The only other way to recover
unit HP is by using magic.<clsr>
Also remember, as HP decreases,
so does the strength of a
unit's attacks.<>

Would you like me to explain
commander HP recovery?<>

A commander can regain 3 HP
if you select the Heal
command.<clsr>
Also, you may recover 2 MP by
doing this.<>

Would you like an explanation
of troop affinity?<>

Each unit type has its own
attributes.<clsr>
Depending on its attributes, it
will have an advantage or
a disadvantage in combat.<clsr>
Here are some of the
basics...<clsr>
Infantry are strong against
pikemen, but weak against
cavalry.<clsr>
Pikemen are strong against
cavalry, but weak against
infantry.<clsr>
Cavalry are strong against
infantry, but weak against 
pikemen.<clsr>
Sea units are slow on land
but fast in the water.<clsr>
Flying units have excellent
mobility, but are incredibly
weak to bowmen.<clsr>
Bowmen can attack the enemy
from a distance and are strong
against flying soldiers.<clsr>
However, if they are attacked
directly, they will often
be destroyed.<clsr>
Think of the map, as well as
the Commanders' arrangement,
before hiring your troops.<>

Would you like an explanation
on how to gain EXP?<>

When a troop defeats an enemy
unit, some EXP is awarded to
its commander.<clsr>
When an enemy commander is
defeated, troops under its
command are destroyed as well.<clsr>
However, no EXP will be gained
from such kills.<clsr>
That's why it's best to defeat
all troops before defeating the
commander.<>

Would you like an explanation
on how to position your
Commanders?<>

Before conducting your sortie,
all your Commander units must
be positioned on the map.<clsr>
Commanders to be positioned
will have their names shown
in bright white.<clsr>
Also, depending on the stage
there may be times when the 
arrangement is fixed.<clsr>
In this case, you can't position
commanders, but you can still
purchase troops and items.<>

You should have a good
understanding of common
tactics by now.<clsr>
Also, don't forget to hire
troops.<clsr>
A single troop could mean the
difference between victory or
defeat.. <>

Well then, I hope to see you
perform your best.<>
