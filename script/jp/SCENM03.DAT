Lord Ledin! It's terrible!<>

Kris, what's wrong, why are you
up so late?<>

The thieves are inside the town!<clsr>
They're fighting and killing the
villagers!<>

you can into the old church!<>

morning people.<>

That one seems to be the
leader... but why isn't he
attacking?<clsr>
He's probably just scared after
seeing all his buddies get
killed!<>

Amatuers!<clsr>
If you can't see the difference
in our power, you have no place
in the battlefield!<>

to be acting up again...<>

You're too persistant for your
own good!<>

the peace of my town!<>

Lord Ledin, there is someone here
who wishes to speak to you!<>

My... prince...<>

Narm?!<clsr>
What are you doing here?<>

The castle...
Oh god... the castle...
... has fallen...<>

WHAT?!<clsr>
My father?! What's happened to
my father?!<>

King Isacc allowed me to escape...
He stayed at the castle alone...
to fight to the end...<>

Father...<clsr>
Lord Hawking, I must leave
immediatly!<>

Then allow me to find some soldiers
to send with you.
That's the least I can do for you.<>

Thank you, I really appreciate it.<>

I am in your debt as well!<>

How is your wound?<>

It's not enough to keep me
out of the battlefield.<>

I understand.
Just be careful.<>

It looks like you'll be leaving
then, Lord Ledin...<>

Kris...<>

I'll pray for your safety in
battle...<>

King Isacc asked that I give this
sword to the prince...<>

Obtained a Great Sword!<>

Father...<>

There's no way I can apologize
for what has happened...<>

No, Narm, it's not your fault.<clsr>
Don't be distressed.<>

Attention all troops!<clsr>
We will now being our march on
Baldea!<>

Yes sir!<>

To avoid the imperial troops,
we'll need to cross through the
Forest of the Dead.<>
