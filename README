langrisserpc
===========

This is a series of tools I am writing for working with Langrisser (I or II)
PC. Currently the archive includes the following:

* langpcdump    - A script for dumping a Langrisser PC resource (.res) file
                  to a folder of the same name. Dumps with script symbols.

* langpcbuild   - Builds a new Langrisser PC resource file using a folder
                  using the contents of a specified folder. Accepts script
                  symbol input and converts ASCII to game format text.

* langpcresdump - As of langpcdump 1.5, you can no longer use that script to
                  dump non-script resource files. This should be used instead.

Check the individual .php files for more documentation and notes.
